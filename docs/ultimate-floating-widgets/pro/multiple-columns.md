## Using multiple columns

Multiple columns can be enabled by selecting "number of columns" to "2/3/4" under "Widget box" in the widget box edit page.

After selecting the required number of columns, in widgets management page multiple sidebars will be created as per the number of columns selected.

Widgets can now be added to the columns as required.
