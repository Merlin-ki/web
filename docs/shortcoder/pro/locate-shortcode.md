Locate shortcode is one of the features available in Shortcoder PRO. With this feature, you can find all the posts (of all post types) where the specific shortcode is used.

Using this information you can know the usage of the shortcode or edit the post manually to make changes to the shortcode if needed.

## Using the feature

The locate shortcode form is available in the Shortcode editing page. You can find the "Locate shortcode" metabox on the right side of the screen.

The form provides options to narrow down the search. You can set filters like _Post type_ and _Post status_ in the locate shortcode form.

In the search results, you can click the name of the post to open the post editing page where you can edit or work on the post further.
